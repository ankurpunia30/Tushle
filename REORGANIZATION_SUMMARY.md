## 🔄 Files Moved and Organized

### Scripts Relocated
- ✅ `create_*.py` → `/scripts/database/`
- ✅ `add_*.py` → `/scripts/database/`  
- ✅ `update_*.py` → `/scripts/database/`

- ✅ Created comprehensive `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- ✅ Created `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` → `/configs/`
- ✅ `railway.json` → `/configs/`
- ✅ Database files → `/backend/data/`

### New Files Created
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Comprehensive version control exclusions
- ✅ `setup.sh` - Complete project setup script
- ✅ `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Detailed structure documentation
- ✅ `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Developer workflow guide

## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

- **Documentation Hierarchy**: Guides, API docs, and references organized
- **Version Control**: Proper .gitignore for clean repositories
- **Scalability**: Structure supports project growth

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow Improvements

### Before Reorganization
```bash
# Files scattered in root directory
# No clear organization
# Manual setup process
# Mixed documentation
```

### After Reorganization
```bash
# Quick setup
./setup.sh

# Clear script locations
python scripts/database/create_dummy_data.py
python scripts/testing/test_pdf_llm.py

# Organized documentation
docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Developers

1. **Use the new structure**: Follow `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for file placement
2. **Run setup script**: Use `./setup.sh` for new environment setup
3. **Follow development guide**: Reference `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
4. **Maintain organization**: Keep files in their designated folders
